# P03: Portfolio

## Description
Individually, you will be developing a portfolio website. Unlike the prior projects which allowed for sites to link to false pages, **this website must be fully functional** (all links and content are real). The following content is required in the project:

* A biography or personal description
* Clear indication of your interests in employment or as a professional
* Two projects presenting your skills using a process analysis
* Contact method(s)

**Any code that is not yours must be cited accordingly.**

## Notes on self-plagiarism
If you have a pre-existing portfolio that you are revising or redesigning for this project we request that you **provide a URL to the original** as part of your final submission. This just helps us ensure that there is no self-plagiarism occurring in the project.

You are allowed to use frameworks (ie. Bootstraps) and libraries to make working on the site easier, but the final design must be your own work. When in doubt, ask the TA or instructor as plagiarism can warrant more serious repercussions.

**Remember that this project is an opportunity to showcase you.** Working with someone else's design or creating a website similar to others doesn't show off your 'unique' nature and students who predominantly use an existing website design or framework do not do well on this project.

## Due
Before your lab time on **Apr 7**.

## Worth
30% of your final grade.

## Instructions
There are a number of weeks in which to complete this project, please pay attention to what is required from you.

### Starting Mar 10
1. Working with the in-lab activity as a starting point, **create a style guide** that defines the visual portion of your **ethos** — the understanding, characteristics and definition of yourself in your portfolio. This style guide should help **visually** define you in the role your portfolio presents: a programmer, game developer, illustrator, designer, content strategist... etc, without being clichéd or a stereotype.
2. Based on the visual ethos you are developing, complete a **process analysis of two projects** which help form a text to support your ethos and show how you created a project from start to finish. The text and accompanying artifacts — images, video, audio, applications, etc — must demonstrate your ability to think through a problem and iterate a project over time. Make sure to also consider how these projects speak to the abilities you are presenting as part of your ethos. Use 250-300 words for each analysis.
3. Write a draft of a bio using no more than 100 words to introduce yourself. Ensure there is a meaningful connection between what you describe here and what your visual and textual ethos express.
Generate an initial set of HTML/CSS templates showing how the visual and textual components of your ethos would be used in your site.

#### Due in your Mar 17 lab:
* 1 ethos style guide
* 2 project process analyses
* 1 bio draft
* 1 set of initial templates

### Starting Mar 17
1. Based on the feedback in the labs, integrate the style guide, process analyses, and bio into your set of templates to build out your initial draft of the complete portfolio. Note:
  * Can we clearly identify your ethos through the visual and textual language being presented?
  * Focus on layout and branding first, flashy effects second
  * Ensure that if working with a framework, it **does not** dictate your design

#### Due in your Mar 24 lab:
* 1 portfolio website mockup with all content active and integrated.

### Starting Mar 24
1. **Test and debug your website.** This should include testing it on:
  * multiple browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
  * multiple devices (mobile phone, tablets, desktop, TVs)
2. **Update and publish your style guide** along with your website. Make sure it includes the addition of any changes made to the original guide, as well as any layouts or structures created since the beginning of P04.

#### Due in your Mar 31 lab:
* 1 updated portfolio website with style guide linked.

### Starting Mar 31
Work with feedback you receive in the lab to revise your portfolio website. Ensure you continue testing it on multiple browsers and devices.

## Final Delivery
Final deliverables are due to Canvas **before your Apr 7 lab** and double-check all your submitted files and URLs to ensure they can be opened. Delivered should be **one URL for a fully completed website**, which includes footer links to:
* complete style guide
* citation web-page
* your git repository (if used, not required)
Please note that **we will test your portfolio website in Chrome and two other random browsers and/or devices.** Ensure there are no concerns with your website by testing early and often.
